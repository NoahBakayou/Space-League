Hi guys, I just think of an interesting concept for our game that I would like to share:

## Game Concept

This will be a space-themed game. The game mechanics will revolve around ball play, similar to Rocket League — except the players will control spacecrafts that is fully traversable in a 3D plane. There are 2 teams of 3 players and there are 2 goalposts at the opposite end of the map. To spice things up, objects such as asteroid fields or shipwrecks can be added in the middle of the map, which makes getting the ball from one side to another more difficult. If a player crashes into an asteroid, they will be spawned back at the starting position, potentially losing control of the ball to the other team.

## Weapon Loadout System

One concept that Noah and I would like to implement is the ability for the players to change their weapon loadout before entering the battle, similar to what I did in my 2D project. However, I don't think having players shoot and destroy each other while also having to play ball would work very well. Therefore, I would like to propose some alternative weapons:

- **Grappling hook**: the player have to aim and shoot the hook at the ball. If hit, it will grab and pull the ball toward the player.
- **EMP missile**: aim and shoot at the enemy player. If hit, immobilized the player for a short amount of time.
- **Smoke launcher**: create a large area of smoke that completely obstructs the player's vision inside. Perfect to use in the asteroid field to blind and cause the enemy player to crash.

Feel free to suggest additional weapon type if you think of something interesting. Your choice of weapon will determine your role in the match.

## Card System

Additionally, we can implement Teague's idea of card system into the game. When a team scores a goal, both teams return to their starting positions. The winning team will receive 1 point to their score counter. The losing team will be able to choose a card to improve their stats. The cards can be one of the followings:

- Increase acceleration & deceleration
- Increase maneuverability
- Increase firing rate of weapons
- Grant a shield in front of goalpost that will stop and deflect ball once
